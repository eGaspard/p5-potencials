# p5-potencials
a d3-treemap on the potencials of processing and p5.js

On December 4th 2016 i've wrote this post to several facebook-groups related to creative coding with p5.js and Processing:

Dear coders,
one and a half year passed since i've started creative coding seriously. It was an amazing time, i've really found a new passion and many very good friends. I'm extremely thankful for that!
This year was full of programming questions, answers, making some generative animations, some gifs for tumblr and much more stuff, people can watch on their screens. But i ask myself more and more how i can use creative coding to make things that don't just affect my coding fellows, but rather people, that did not know that creative coding exist.
Check this out, here are some ideas: Generative jewellery, audioreactive live visuals, reactive art installations, data visualization, media-led-walls for buildings and so on and on.
Let me try to summarize this:
What can we make with creative coding?
I've started to collect these ideas in a mind map in adobe illustrator, but i now i think it would be much better to have an interactive, dynamic mind map hosted on github, so everybody can contribute. What do you think about that idea?
Enjoy your sunday! Greetz!
Tim
